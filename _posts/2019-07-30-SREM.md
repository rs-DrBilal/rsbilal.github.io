#### **SREM: Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method** 

Atmospheric correction/surface reflectance estimation is a crucial preprocessing step which is always required for estimation of biophysical parameters. SREM is much simpler and user-friendly method compared to the USGS/NASA methods and have similar accuracy as the USGS/NASA methods.
