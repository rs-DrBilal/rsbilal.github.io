			<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:20px;"> I received the BSc (Hons) degree (major in Remote Sensing) in 2008 from University of the Punjab, Lahore (Pakistan), 
				the MS degree (major in Meteorology and Remote Sensing) in 2010 from COMSATS University Islamabad (Pakistan), and 
				the Ph.D. degree (major in Remote Sensing) in 2013 from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), Hong Kong. 
				I am the first Pakistani (among 300 candidates from Pakistan) who was selected for the prestigious Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship in 2010. 
				From 2014 to 2017, I was working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at PolyU and joined Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology as a Professor in October 2017. 
				In October 2018, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department has awarded me with the special title of “Distinguished Professor” based on my excellent research achievements. 
				I have developed three robust methods, i.e., 
				(i) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.04.014" style="color: NAVY">Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA)</a>, 
				(ii) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.028" style="color: NAVY">Simplified Merge Scheme for Dark Target and Deep Blue aerosol algorithms</a>, and 
				(iii) <a href=" https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11111344" style="color: NAVY">Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method (SREM)</a>. 
				I have published 50 research articles as the first and co-author in the renowned International journals.  
				I am serving as a Peer-reviewer for more than 30 journals and have provided 134 reviews. For more detail, please visit my following Research Profiles</p>
