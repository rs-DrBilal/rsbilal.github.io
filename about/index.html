			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I received the BSc (Hons) degree (major in Remote Sensing) in 2008 from University of the Punjab (Pakistan), the MS degree (major in Meteorology and Remote Sensing) in 2010 from COMSATS University Islamabad (Pakistan), and the Ph.D. degree (major in Remote Sensing) in 2013 from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), Hong Kong. I am the first Pakistani (among 300 candidates from Pakistan) who was selected for the prestigious Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship in 2010. From 2014 to 2017, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at PolyU and joined the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST) as a Professor in October 2017. In 2018, I was awarded the special title of “Distinguished Professor” by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department.</p> 
			<p>I have been engaged in high-resolution retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and estimation of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) using satellite remote sensing. My research applications also include the estimation of land surface reflectance using multi-sensor data. I have developed “Simplified Aerosol Retrievals Algorithm (SARA)” for high-resolution retrievals of AOD at a regional scale and published it in the top Environmental Remote Sensing Journals such as Remote Sensing of Environment, Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmosphere, Atmospheric Research, and Aerosol and Air Quality Research. SARA is cited by 240 times since September 2013 according to Google Scholar. Recently, I have developed a new method “Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method (SREM)” to estimate surface reflectance for diverse land surfaces using multi-sensor data and published it in Remote Sensing Journal. Overall, I have published more than 40 SCI/SCIE papers as a first and co-author which are cited by more than 700 times. For more detail, please visit my Research Profiles:</p>
